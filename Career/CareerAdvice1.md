# 10 Tips from 30 tips

1. Forgot the degree. Focus on the now. You have no excuse you can use to get out of being the best version of you.
2. Try to learn ONE language per year. That one language by the end of the year. You should be an expert in.
3. There's someone doing something better than you? Don't see them as competition. See them as an asset. Learn from them.
   Even if you're more senior than them. Envy leads to pride. Humility will take you higher.
4. TAKE a walk
5. Invest in yourself. Youtube is good. O'reilly is even better.

6. Motivation like all sentiments, come and go, use discipline instead.
7. What's your vision, it'll help you filter out things.
8. Focus has a cost.
9. If you stop learning, you are already obsolete
10. Consistency > intensity; 20-30 min per day > 7 hours on Sunday
