Once you have gathered requirements, you want to use them to for users stories.
THese are statements about the role of the user, what action they wish to take, and why
format:
AS a _role__ (ex: User), I want _____, so that____
sometimes the last clause is not require when the user story is simple or obvious
SOmetimes you cn have different roles takiing the same action for different reasons

Once you have that, (sometimes in your ticket), you can then create objects to solve problem.
Think in terms of objects.
Nouns typically are a good place to start to look for your objects.
Next verbs might elucidate functionality, ex: purchase or add
You might also start to glean connections as you determine the relationship of objects
to other objects. Example A shopper's relationship to one shopping cart instance.

Remember user stories are used to express software requirements, and we can use this to start
thinking in object oriented; doing this ahead of implementation, will help us write clean and organized code.
